Divide And Conquer 
This technique can be divided into the following three parts:

1.Divide: This involves dividing the problem into smaller some sub-problems.
2.Conquer: Solve all some sub-problems by calling recursively until solved.
3.Combine: Combine the all some sub-problems to get the final solution of the whole problem.


e.g. QuickSort (O(nÂ²)),MergeSort(O(nlogn)) but still QuickSort is fast algorithm as compare to merge sort.We will cover this also in this Divide and conquer.

e.g. Binary Search(Partial Divide and Conquer technique)
